# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was made to create a simple web application to help guide my course work and know the basics of web development, familiarize myself with topics that will be expanded on in this course, and to get hands-on practice building web applications. I learned how Github is used and the jargon around pull requests, commits, merging branches, etc.
